# EveryRoseHasItsThorn
We shall see what comes of it.

Currently only works on my desktop. Tried getting it to run on my laptop but the repo seems to have been set up wrong.
Not Surprised. Will work on creating a new repo when done. This repo just holds the code with none of the setup to download and run
available.
